### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [The War Eternal](https://github.com/Alexander-Malchev/The-war-eternel)
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ language
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project containing backend, frontend and games
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about problems with JS, Node JS, python (not sure if I can answer everything), html, css, c++ and bugs in your code.
ðŸ“« How to reach me: on discord (Amah_1113#1361), email (alex.malchev@abv.bg)
